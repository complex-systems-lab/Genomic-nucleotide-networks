Open the One_find_variable_sites.java file in any editor and edit the path and name of fasta file and save the file in a directory.
Open terminal and go into the directory where file is saved and run this file using command javac.
It will generate three files named as "FileList.dat", "VList.dat", "VSeqList.dat".
"FileList.dat" contains the names of each sequence in the fasta file.
"VList.dat" contains all the variable sites.
"VSeqList.dat" contains the sequences with only varibale sites.
Next, run
